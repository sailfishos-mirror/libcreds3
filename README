This package offers a generalised task credentials access.

This is setup to use automake tools and generated scripts and files
are not included!

For debian package building:

    dpkg-buildpackage

For manual building:

    autoreconf -i -f -s
    ./configure
    make

This library is really designed to utilize a kernel extension, which
allows direct reading of a subset of credentials (UID, GID,
supplementary groups and effective capabilities) of any task.

The header ./sys/creds.h defines the library API (installed as
/usr/include/sys/creds.h).

However, if the kernel extension is not present, the library falls
back to using /proc/<pid>/status for getting this information. The
fallback solution can only return at most 32 supplementary groups,
which is the current limitation of the /proc/<pid>/status.


The build also creates "libcreds3-tools" package, which contains some
simple utilities used in testing. These are not documented.

* creds-test [creds-string ...]

  does simple credentials name/number conversions

* creds-get [-p pid] [-m wildcard]

  shows current credentials of a process
